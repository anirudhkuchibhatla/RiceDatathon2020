# RiceDatathon2020

Our project aims to solve a regression problem by aiming to predict the Rate of Prediction given other parameters for the Chevron Challenge at the Rice Datathon 2020. 

The final results are in submission.csv. The explanation and presentation are in Chevron_ Rate of Penetration.pdf. All of the other files are the code we used to develop the final results.
